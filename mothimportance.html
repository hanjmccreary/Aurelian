			<h3>Natural Beauty</h3>
			<p>Saturniidae moths are incredibly beautiful and unique creatures. There are among 2000 species of Silkmoths across the world and art among the largest winged insects on the planet. They have no functioning mouth parts and do not feed, as their sole purpose is mating.  Females tend to be larger than males and don't fly much due to the hundreds of eggs they carry. The males use their antennae to sense females pheromones in order to mate.</p>

			<h3>Cultural Contribution</h3>
			<p>The pupa and larvae of Silkmoths are a common food among Asia and Africa. They make a cheap source of nutrition in areas where food can be hard to come by. In Zimbabwe, they are used in a dish known as 'Mopani worms,'  a diet staple in rural communities, and delicacy in cities. In South Korea, they are used in a street food dish known as 'Beondegi,' a nutty and chewy snack.</p>

			<h3>The Silk Trade</h3>
			<p>Saturniidae moths produce silk in South East Asia - but they don't produce the silk you're likely thinking of. Traditional Chinese silk is made by the Bombyx Moro, from the sister family Bombycidae. Saturniid moths produce 'Tussar' silk. This silk is less durable and more textured and is largely produced in India and used for tribal garments.</p>
