		<h3>Our Mission</h3>
		<p>Our Mission here at Aurelian is to share our love and appreciation of Saturniidae moths with our site visitors. We hope to do so by educating our viewers on not only how beautiful silk moths are, but how important they are to economies and cultures across the world. </p>

		<h3>Our Story</h3>
		<p>Aurelian first began in 2020 after founder Whitney Klein found an injured Luna moth in her backyard during the pandemic. She nurtured the Luna moth back to health, and began researching all about silkmoths. She began raising her own silkmoths, and started Aurelian to share her appreciation for this amazing insect.</p>
